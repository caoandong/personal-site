the duration of video and the quality of video: for how long the video becomes indistinguishable from reality?

the competitive dynamics means that many players will enter into the race 
differentiate into long movies and real-time video generation

who benefitted the most from these?
* the model labs
* routers like FAL
* router-like products like higgsfield
* influencers who teach people how to use this
* small animation studios (?)
* content platforms for short series (?)

to-agent: can agents become a consumer for the video content?

if content creation becomes free, what becomes scarce and valuable? the script writers? the taste makers?

agent end-to-end production:
* why can't bytedance do this? router? the sota frontier changes so people always want the best model?
what makes a product sticky?

ppl still prefer to consume the content on the existing platform
we need new content format to create new platforms; maybe movie-based games? i think these might finally work; previously they require extremely high frequency interactions that makes it feel very tiresome; also the visual qualities are trash; now that video production is cheap and high-quality we can make infinitely branching interactive stories

sora app didn't work; why is that? it wasn't fun to scroll through the content 

predictions 
by the end of the year there will be no difference between ai generated short videos and human directed short videos (under 30 minutes)

when images became turing complete, who captured the most value?
* the model labs (google gemini)
* the routers and router-like apps
* the individuals (youtubers and influencers)

i want to rapidly iterate on different use cases and ideas
i want an agent that can explore new mediums with these tools quickly
i think movies and anime and explainers should share the same backbone but with different skills

fundamentally the bottleneck here is intelligence:
* i want an agent that can produce long videos reliably from high-level prompts and references
agentic search for video content


to agent
most content will be made by agents
claude code / codex / openclaw handles everything
the infra around the agentic content production is going to be important

video as code
most of the video production is going to be agents


all videos will be made by agents
* humans are the producers like kevin feige or miyazaki

most videos will be consumed by agents

what's scarce:
* great stories and taste makers (i.e. producers)
* energy and compute and memory and storage and network bandwidth

most video production will be end-to-end so specialized workflows will be dead

there will be more than one foundational model providers and they will have strengths in different areas; one of them will be open source

everyone will have their personalized content producers - eventually pixels streamed directly to their phones

code is the fundamental language for agents; video generator is a compiler / renderer from code

demand: short videos, short drama, short anime, games 

what's missing:
* good video production agent (prob coming)
* good producer / writer agent that tells the model what to generate
* good curator of videos that gives feedback and iterate on the video
* good search engine that index and search relevant content across the internet
* good monetization mechanism for ai videos
* good repo for managing video production assets



ultimately:
the pixel stream that hacks the brain
end-to-end optimizing sensory stream to hack the human brain
